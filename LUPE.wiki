<!-- Learning The Unix Programming Environment -->

This is a series of practical tutorials on Unix - mainly GNU/Linux and OSX - in the context of modern programming practice. It is an up-to-date learning supplement to the great [[LRE#Os_Melhores|UPE]] book, "The Unix Programming Environment" by Kernighan and Ritchie. In addition to summarizing the outstanding classic and adapting it for current environments, LUPE also gathers a number of valuable practical tips and pointers from experienced programmers.

==First: read UPE==

Even though LUPE is reasonably self-contained and covers what is most immediately useful to you, reading the original masterpiece - UPE - is highly recommended. Specially the exercises. Reading UPE is ''the'' top way of learning Unix at a level most useful to programmers. Raeding it will be the single thing that ''really'' makes you understand the tools, the idiosyncratic syntax, and why Unix's highly programmable interface works the way it does. Really understanding the practical tools and the power user side of the OS is what makes a highly efficent programmer and user. With the LUPE supplements you'll leverage that powerful knowledge into the broader context of today's practice of programming and advanced usage.


==Background==


==Basics==

Open a terminal (by launching the Terminal app). Play some commands and constructs of the Shell (sh) environment language:

List files in the current directory/foder:

 ls

A common shortcut for ls is d, though it is not always available. Try it anyways: 

 d

In the aliases section we'll set this useful shortcut up in case you don't have it by default.

Also try these
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 ls -a                                 # "all" - shows entries starting with '.', usually hidden
 ls -l
 ls -la
</syntaxhighlight>

For which a useful short is
 ll
Don't worry if you don't have <tt>ll</tt> - we'll set it up later.

Tell the computer to print "Hello, World":

 echo hello, world

Then tell it to print this 10 times using a for loop in the bash language (just type it for now - we'll help you understand the syntax idiosyncrasies later):
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo hello, world; done 
</syntaxhighlight>

Each Unix command is an executable program, which is usually written in C or can be internally modeled with C's abstraction. As in C, each command has a return value and default/standard input and output handles (stdout/stdin).

The standard input and output can be redirected.  
Create a text file containing hello, world using the redirect operator

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
echo hello, world > a.txt
</syntaxhighlight>

Print out the contents of the file
 cat a.txt

You can use the redirect operator on any command construct that has an output, even on the for construct above:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo hello, world; done > a.txt
</syntaxhighlight>

Count the number of words in the file
 wc -l a.txt

The UPE book masterfully explains why you should prefer that over (try it)
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 cat a.txt | wc -l 
</syntaxhighlight>

You'll understand what the pipe `|' means later, but it basically connects the default output of a program to the standard input of another.

===Command History===

 history

Gives a numbered list of your previous commands. You can ask for previous command number 17 using
 !17
 
Instead of pressing UP multiple times. Another way is to search history by keyword as you type.
Lets say you're trying to reverse search the above for statement. You can do this:
# type Control-R
# type any substring of the desired command, say <tt>for</tt>
# a command matching that substring is displayed
# press Enter to execute it, or keep pressing Control-R to search for other options

You can also refer to the previous command's 3rd argument on your current command:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 wc -l a.txt
 cat !!:2
</syntaxhighlight>

Your history is located in your home directory, which can be referred to by <tt>'~'</tt>
 cat ~/.history

On many setups this will contain the history up to a previous session. The current history is usually not stored in ~/.history until the session is over.

===Further basics===

Pressing Control-C usually aborts any command that is running interactively through the shell.
Other commands that are not blocking the shell can be ended using <tt>kill</tt> and <tt>killall</tt>:
 killall firefox

Or kill, which requires a process ID associated to a running app:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 ps -A|grep firefox
    553

 kill 553
</syntaxhighlight>

If it doesnt go away, use -9 or -KILL
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 killall -9 firefox
 kill -KILL 553
</syntaxhighlight>

A reference to any single command is provided by <tt>man</tt>:
 man bc

The standard sections of the manual include:
<small>

  1      User Commands
  2      System Calls
  3      C Library Functions
  4      Devices and Special Files
  5      File Formats and Conventions
  6      Games et. Al.
  7      Miscellanea
  8      System Administration tools and Deamons
</small>

You can ask <tt>man</tt> to look up an entry on a determined manual.
If you want the C function, you can skip shell commands by using
 man 3 printf

To search where a given keyword, eg <tt>exec</tt>, appears in all the manuals
 apropos exec


===Scripting===
The shell is a full-fledged programming language which derives its power from
being able to very easily control and combine commands to work together inside
the OS environment. You can combine the above commands into a ''shell script''
using any text editor. Or you can just type
 
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 echo 'ls | wc -l
       echo thats the number of files in the current folder.' > script.sh
</syntaxhighlight>

Check whats inside the script.sh file
  cat script.sh

Run the command
  sh script.sh

Usually you won't edit using echo, but using more convenient editors.
There are even variables you can use. Lets say we put the following into <tt>script.sh</tt>
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 #!/bin/sh
 num_files=`ls | wc -l`
 echo $num_files is the number of files in the current folder.
</syntaxhighlight>
  
You can also make it executable and even remove the extension so it becomes more like a command itself.
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 mv script.sh script
 chmod a+x script
 ./script
</syntaxhighlight>

===More useful and fun stuff to try and understand later===

Warning: The following commands may require the appropriate software packages to be installed to your system.  
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
# Convert images
 convert image.png image.jpg

# Convert all images to a PDF
 convert *.jpg document.pdf

# Play videos
 mplayer movie.mkv

# Extract pages from a pdf
 pdftk old.pdf cat 1-9 26-end output new.pdf
 
# Extract all frames of a video
 mplayer video.mp4 -vo png -frames 5
 
# Make a GIF animation from images
 convert  -adjoin  -loop 0  -delay 5  *.gif  animation.gif
</syntaxhighlight>

==Setting up the modern unix programming environment==

===Useful script collections===


====Our utilitiess====
Our personal scripts in current use and actual config files used for editing,
programming, and daily use is available at [[Utils|Utils-Macambira]].


====Funcoeszz====
A nifty collection of little shell utilities, having a portuguese slant to them.
They can be found at [http://funcoeszz.net funcoeszz.net]. I personally use:
* <tt>zzarrumanome</tt> - convert file names to lowercase and spaces to underscore, useful for shell scripting
 zzarrumanome *
      RAMONES - I Don't Care.mp3 -> ramones-i_dont_care.mp3
      Toy Dolls - Wakey, Wakey!.mp3 -> toy_dolls-wakey_wakey.mp3
* <tt>zztradutor</tt>
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 zztradutor pt-de livro                # Buch
</syntaxhighlight>


===Configuring Bash for programming===

The following are most useful BASH configuration files
  ~/.bashrc
  ~/.bash_profile
  ~/.bash_aliases
The <tt>.bash_profile</tt> shell script is meant to be executed once per work session - upon your login to the system or upon starting a login shell as in <tt>bash -ls</tt>.
The <tt>.bashrc</tt> script is executed during each new shell that is started, as when typing <tt>bash</tt> at the prompt. The <tt>.bash_aliases</tt> shell script is executed by a suitably configured <tt>.bashrc</tt> and by convention contains only alias/shortcut definitions. For instance, 
 alias fox="firefox"              # you can now just type fox to start firefox

What should you put in <tt>~/.bashrc</tt> and <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt>?  You
should take a look at the existing ones in your system, and copy from more
experienced friends. The ones I actually use on a daily basis are available at
[[Utils]].
 
====~/bin====
Create your own <tt>~/bin</tt> folder to install the personal scripts that you'll be using often:
 mkdir ~/bin

Move the desired script, say <tt>myscript</tt>, there:
 mv myscript ~/bin

Now change permissions to execute
 chmod a+x ~/bin/myscript

Set the path in your ~/.bash_profile
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
</syntaxhighlight>

Reload the environment for changes to take effect
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 bash -ls          # start as login shell, reloading .profile
                     # XOR
 . ~/.bash_profile
</syntaxhighlight>

You can now run your script without the <tt>./</tt>:
 myscript

You should use the <tt>cx</tt> shortcut given in UPE for making things more simple.
 cx ~/bin/myscript

You can get our actual working versions of <tt>cx</tt> and other utilities suggested by UPE at
[[Utils]] (''do'' peek at the source code!).

==Understanding the Bourne shell==
Think about the internal C implementation model for commands. The commands's <tt>main()</tt> function sees its arguments through <tt>argv</tt> - the entire argument line broken into a number of strings. It is the shell that breaks the entire command string as in
  "echo hello, world"      --- sh --->      "echo" "hello," "world"
into distinct components.  Understanding this process is key to understanding how the shell works,
specially how to use the different quotes `'" and the escape character '\' .

The program <tt>echo</tt> can only see two distict "hello" and "world" strings
in its <tt>argv</tt> for the above example. For it to see "hello world" as a unit,
quotes can be employed:
 echo "hello, world"

The behavior looks identical to that of the
original unquoted command, but you can be sure that the actual echo program is
now seeing <tt>hello world</tt> as a ''single'' entity. For instance, 
to print a file that has spaces in the filename, you can do
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 cat "unix programming.txt"
                                  #OR
 cat 'unix programming.txt'
</syntaxhighlight>

You can also escape the space, since the shell breaks the argument at blanks.

 cat unix\ programming.txt

What's the difference?
* <b>'</b>: the strongest quote, preventing the shell to parse, expand, modify nor split whats inside
* <b>"</b>: allows the shell to expand expressions inside before generating the single, final string 
* <b>\</b>: not as convenient and is not guaranteed to generate a single final string, e.g. if shell expansions expand to space

These shell expansions are most used with variables. Lets test this behavior:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 a="power nix"                        # single quotes ' could be used
 echo "hello, $a world"
 echo 'hello, $a world'
 echo hello,\ $a\ world               # test: what is argc here?
</syntaxhighlight>

This illustrates $a which expands the variable a - you can think of <tt>$</tt> as an S for "substitute in here the contents of what follows".

'''And what is that weird backward''' <tt>`</tt> '''quote for?''' ''It executes the string that is inside as a shell command and stores the ouput as a single string''. You can think of it as "the output of", and it is extremely useful. Try it out:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
  seq 1 10
  numbers=`seq 1 10`
  echo $numbers         # numbers == "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
  numbers="seq 1 10"    # numbers == "seq 1 10"   literally
  echo $numbers
  numbers=$(seq 1 10)   # you can use $( ) instead of ` `
  echo $numbers
</syntaxhighlight>

Let us take a look at one of the commands in the intro section to print hello world, say, 3 times, written more nicely:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 for i in `seq 1 3`; do 
    echo hello, world
 done 
</syntaxhighlight>
The <tt>for</tt> loop simply loops the variable <tt>i</tt> over each token obtained by the shell when parsing the string after <tt>in</tt>. For instance, 
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 for i in a b c; do              # or for i in 1 2 3   etc
    echo hello, world
 done 
</syntaxhighlight>
Would print hello, world 3 times, We're plugging in an independent command, <tt>seq</tt>, in order to generate the for loop string. By itself, 
 seq 1 3
simply prints 1 to 3. We can use seq's output as a string by enclosing it in back quotes:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 mystring=`seq 1 4`
                                 #OR
 mystring=$(seq 1 4) 
 echo $mystring
</syntaxhighlight>
Since we know that the shell will break this string at blanks, in case its content were used as part of a commandline. Thus, we just give it to the for loop. 


==Processes and Jobs==

Running a program interactively normally blocks further input
 command
 # input is blocked
Type <tt>Control-C</tt> to stop the process in case it is still running.
If the process is waiting for input, type <tt>Control-D</tt> to signal end of
input (end of file) and exit.

Run a command in the background ("in parallel")
 command &                       # the ampersand & is like "run command and (&) whatever I type next"

Bring it back to foreground
 fg
then background 
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 # type Control-Z
 bg
</syntaxhighlight>

Run multiple commands in the background ("in parallel")
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 command1 & 
 command2 & 
 command3 & 
</syntaxhighlight>

List the running jobs spawned by the current shell
 jobs

Each job has a job id and each process has a process id.
Make job number 2 foreground, then background again:
 fg 2
 bg

Stop command2 by name
 killall command2

Look into all running processes and respective resources
 top

List all running processes with pids
 ps -A

List all running processes named <tt>command3</tt>
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 ps -A | grep command3
</syntaxhighlight>

List jobs by pid
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 jobs -p         # outputs PID 2143
</syntaxhighlight>

Force kill
 kill 2143

Wait for all jobs to finish
 wait

Keep running program on the computer even after you log out:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 nohup command &
                        #OR
 nohup ls -lR / &
</syntaxhighlight>

When you log back in (say, via ssh), there will be a file called
<tt>nohup.out</tt> with the output of the process.

You can also use GNU screen for persistent terminal sessions.

==Networking==


===SSH===

Log onto another machine in your local network:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 ssh username@10.0.0.60
</syntaxhighlight>

Execute arbitrary commands in it interactively
 ls
 uname -v

Log off
 exit

Execute one command on the remote machine non-interactively
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 ssh username@10.0.0.60 who                  # tells you who is logged in the remote machine
</syntaxhighlight>

Copy a file onto the machine
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 echo testing >a.txt                         # creates the file
 scp a.txt 10.0.0.60:                        # scp /local_path/file username@remote:/remote_path
</syntaxhighlight>

Automated transfer session with <tt>sftp</tt>
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 sftp usrname@hostname << END
 <password>
 put filename1
 put filename2
 get filename3
 bye
 END
</syntaxhighlight>

Open the remote computer's browser on your own local screen
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 ssh -X username@10.0.0.60
 firefox                                     # or any other program that needs a GUI
</syntaxhighlight>

PS: you might have to configure X support, ask a local technicial or Google.

Public key (passwordless) authentication (cf. [https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/])

Generate a public key
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
</syntaxhighlight>

Add the key to your ssh-agent so you don't have to type  the password all the time
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 # start the ssh-agent in the background
 eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</syntaxhighlight>

Test it by communicatibg between two machines: machine 1 (eg, the one where you generated the key, the 'local' machine) ssh-''ing'' into machine 2 (a 'remote' machine).

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
 scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub maquina2:.ssh/
</syntaxhighlight>


===Basics===

Discover other hosts on your LAN 

 ping -b 10.0.0.0             # broadcast Ping on your local network address
